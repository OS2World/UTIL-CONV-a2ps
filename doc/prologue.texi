@table @samp
@item bold
This style is meant to replace the old option @code{-b} of a2ps 4.3.
It is a copy of the black and white prologue, but in which all the fonts
are in Bold.

@item bw
Style is plain: pure black and white, with standard fonts.

@item color
Colors are used to highlight the keywords.

@item diff
This style is meant to be used with the @code{udiff}, @code{wdiff}
style sheets, to underline the differences.  New things are in bold
on a diff background, while removed sequences are in italic.

@item fixed
This style uses exclusively fixed size fonts.  You should use this style
if you want the tabulations to be properly printed.

There are no means to use a fixed size Symbol font, therefore you should
not use the heavy highlighting style.

@item gray
Gray background is used for comments and labels.

@item gray2
Black background is used for comments and labels.

@item matrix
The layout is the same as @samp{bw}, but alternating gray and white lines.
There are two macros defining the behavior:
@samp{pro.matrix.cycle} defines the length of the cycle (number of white
and gray lines).  It defaults to 6.
@samp{pro.matrix.gray} defines the number of gray lines.  Default is 3.

@item ul
This style uses bold faces and underlines, but never italics.  This is
particularly meant for printing formatted man pages.

@end table
